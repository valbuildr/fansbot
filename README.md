## Python Version

I've ensured that this works with Python version **3.13.3**. Support for other versions is unlikely.

## This project uses Artificial Intelligence as an aid, but not a replacement.

AI is only used for debugging tricky errors and in implementing new features that are beyond my knowledge.

Contributors should also adopt this usage case.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is on [Notion](https://petite-chip-1b8.notion.site/e0f81992adda4e33bd3de7653323c0e7?v=e32eac76603f4e9fb2da86784cb32122).
